 Composition mode is the app's behavior when a new data is collected by the middleware. The possibilities are:

- SEND_WHEN_IT_ARRIVES
- GROUP_ALL
- FREQUENCY
  - setFrequency(value)


### ‚öôÔ∏è The Digital phenotyping manager
```
digitalPhenotypingManager = new DPManager.Builder(this)
                .setExternalServer("nameserver.com",1883)
                .setCompositionMode(CompositionMode.FREQUENCY)
                .setFrequency(15)
                .build();
        digitalPhenotypingManager.start();
```

### Stop the Digital phenotyping manager
```sh
digitalPhenotypingManager.stop();
```

## üß∞ Plugin
